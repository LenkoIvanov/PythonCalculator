# PythonCalculator
A Python project, I'm doing for an assignment.

The program can calculate simple arithmetic operations and has a very basic memory system. The project is divided in 3 parts:
V1.0 - a console app with a memory system of a single variable;
V2.0 - a GUI app with a memory system of a single variable;
v3.0 - a GUI app with a more complex memory system (can store more than one value, up to a limit).

TODO//
V2.0
V3.0
convert V3.0 into an executable file, which runs on multiple different systems
