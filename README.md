# PythonCalculator
A Python project, I'm doing for an assignment.

The first part consists of a simple console calculator with a simple memory system.

The second part  is a GUI scientific calculator made with the tkinter module. 

The GUI scientific calculator is finished!
The development was a bit troubled, due to some deadlines, overall uni workload and unfamiriality with the Tkinter module (first project in Tkinter).
I would like to revisit this project later on and mostly restructure the code. If possible, I would use separate files for the functions and error messages.
I would also like to play with the memory functions a bit and maybe extend it. There is a lot of room for improvment, but I learned a lot.
Overall pretty pleased with the result, given the circumstances.
