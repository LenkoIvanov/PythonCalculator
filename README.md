# PythonCalculator
A Python project, I'm doing for an assignment.

The program can calculate simple arithmetic operations and has a very basic memory system. The project is divided in 3 parts:

V1.0 - a console app with a memory system of a single variable;

V2.0 - a GUI app with a memory system of a single variable;
